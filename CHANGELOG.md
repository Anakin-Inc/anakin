# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- **Domain config patterns containing commas** — `failurePatterns` and `requiredPatterns` were stored comma-joined in a `TEXT` column and split back on `,`, so any regex with a quantifier such as `captcha.{0,50}` was torn into two broken patterns on the next read; failure detection then silently stopped firing for that domain. The list columns now round-trip as JSON, and legacy comma-joined rows are still read (`server/internal/domain/repository.go`)
- **Proxy latency tracking** — the average latency EMA now seeds with the first observed sample instead of blending it against a zero baseline, which had caused a proxy's first request to be recorded at ~20% of its true latency (`server/internal/proxy/pool.go`)

## v0.1.1 (2026-03-20)

### Added
- **Anonymous telemetry** — event-level usage telemetry with hourly batch reporting (opt-out: `TELEMETRY=off`). See [TELEMETRY.md](TELEMETRY.md)
- **Transparency endpoint** — `GET /v1/telemetry/status` shows exactly what telemetry data will be sent
- **Startup banner notice** — telemetry status displayed on server boot
- **Privacy documentation** — `TELEMETRY.md` details what is and isn't collected
